A little utility for porting projects out of coffeescript to plain javascript. It's currently simply a coffee compiler wrapper which preserves more of the comments in coffeescript source.

## todo?
Furhter improving readability compared to simply compiling.
  * comments which are appended to a line of code.
  * for...in loops are awkward
  * ternary ops are overused
